# üß† GitHub Copilot 2025 ‚Äî Chat Contexts Guide

Boost your productivity by providing **precise context** to GitHub Copilot Chat. This guide lists all available context types that developers and test engineers can use to supercharge AI assistance inside VS Code.

Each context type uses a `#` tag in the prompt to **explicitly include relevant code, data, or output** in your query.

Include all files within a specific folder.  
**Example:**  
`#Folders Summarize the logic in the utils/ folder.`

---

### `#Codebase`
Let Copilot search your full codebase to answer intelligently.  
**Example:**  
`#Codebase How is the access token generated in this app?`

---

## üîç Symbol & Code Selection Contexts

### `#Symbols` or `#sym`

**Example:**  
`#selection What does this selected code block do?`

---

`#terminalLastCommands Why did my last few Git commands fail?`

---

## üö® Debugging & Test Contexts

### `#Problems`
Include a specific issue from the Problems panel (like ESLint/TypeScript).  
**Example:**  
`#Problems How can I fix this TS error in App.tsx?`

---

### `#Test failures` or `#testFailure`
Include details from failed test cases.  
**Example:**

## ‚úÖ Best Practices

- Use **multiple context tags** to give Copilot deeper insight.
- Combine `#Files`, `#Symbols`, and `#Test failures` for full bug investigations.
- Use `#usage` and `#searchResults` for deep refactoring and traceability.
- Tag output (`#Terminal command output`) right after running a command.

## üöÄ Example Prompt with Multiple Contexts

```txt
#Files #Symbols #Test failures 
Why is the login test failing in `auth.test.js`, and how can I fix the validateCredentials function?
